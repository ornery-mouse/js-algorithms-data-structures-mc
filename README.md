## Object and Array Big 0

1. Objects
    - Accessing, inserting, removing: O(1)
    - Searching O(N)

    Methods
    - hasOwnProperty O(1)
    - .keys, values, entries O(N)

2. Arrays
    - push/pop O(1)
    - almost everything else O(N)

## Problem Solving

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/simplify
- Look back and refactor

### Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs, what should they look like?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data?

## Explore Concrete Examples

1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

- Provides sanity checks
- User stories
- Unit tests

## Break It Down

- PSEUDOCODE
- PSEUDOCODE
- PSEUDOCODE

## Solve or Simplify

- Solve the problem, if you can't: solve a simpler problem

1. Find the core difficulty
2. Temporarily ignore
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Incorporate difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of you solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
